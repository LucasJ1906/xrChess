Prototype of a XR chess game for Oculus quest 3 using Unity 


The chess game engine is working, but there is no UI. 

TODO : 

- Create a User interface to enable the user to chose color (whith or black), computer ELO, restart game, etc..
- Create an interface to enable the user to connect to lichess and play against other lichess user.
